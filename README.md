An implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for the simulation of real-time fluid flow. The simulation case  is  a simplified dam break case, in which a water column is allowed to fall inside a fixed container. The goal was to model the flow of a collapsing water column in real-time, while being accurate and producing convincing looking fluid flow. The explicit first order Euler scheme used for computing the timesteps. Eigen needed for linear algebra operations.
